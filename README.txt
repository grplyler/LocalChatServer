Local chat server coded in Python that runs in terminal using the telnet command.

**Instructions**

1) Open three terminal windows
2) In the first one use the cd command to navigate towards the file's directory
3) In that same window run the code by doing   python telnetChatServer.py
4) In the other two terminal windows write    telnet 127.0.0.1 6666
5) Chat between those two termminal windows

-- 6666 is the PORT number I used in the code, if you change that then change it when you write the command



*Idea and some of the code from Derek Banas, I added several things to it.*
